16219,Greenwood Folding Guest Table,"The concept for an upscale, storable guest table was originally created for a client who was constructing a luxury West Coast resort (go take a look at www.terranea.com).

No need to set a banquet on a particle board fold-up from Sams Club! And because it stores and is often moved from place to place, we produced hand-forged corners. Again, they are beautiful ornaments that scream quality, but they also protect the most vulnerable parts of this wonderful table. It comes in either 6 or 8 foot lengths and is 30"" wide (standard).You have your choice of wood species and finishes for the top, and several different options for finishing the iron just the way you want it to be.
